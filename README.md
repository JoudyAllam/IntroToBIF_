# CTLA-4 Conservation & Evolution Study

This repository contains a computational analysis of the structural conservation and evolutionary divergence of the CTLA-4 protein (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4), a critical regulator of immune homeostasis. The study explores domain-level conservation, multiple sequence alignments, and phylogenetic relationships across species using publicly available protein data.

## Objectives
- Investigate conserved domains within CTLA-4 using multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
- Visualize conserved residues and motifs using WebLogo
- Infer evolutionary relationships using phylogenetic trees constructed with iTOL
- Highlight the immunological relevance of conserved regions

## Tools & Resources
- **UniProt**: Protein sequence retrieval  
- **Clustal Omega / MUSCLE**: Multiple sequence alignment  
- **WebLogo**: Visualization of conserved residues  
- **iTOL (Interactive Tree of Life)**: Phylogenetic tree construction and annotation  

## Summary
The analysis reveals strong conservation in CTLA-4â€™s Ig-like V-type domain across vertebrates, supporting its evolutionary importance in immune checkpoint regulation. Conserved residues suggest functional relevance for ligand binding and immune modulation, with implications in cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease research.
